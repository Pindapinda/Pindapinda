Hi, I'm Stefan Driessen and I am a PhD candidate at the JADE lab of the Jheronimus Academy of Data Science.

I have research projects in blockchain, as well as data markets, assessing data quality and the intersection between these subjects! If you have any questions regarding my work or are interested in collaborating with me on something cool let me know by sending an email to s.w.driessen@jads.nl
